    No default on purpose: the right value tracks the deployed AGENT image
    (its container's home directory), not the tofu-modules ref this install
    happens to pin, and the two are versioned independently. The module's own
    convenience default has in fact changed across the refs read while
    building this install: "/root/.np" at tofu-modules v7.1.0 and earlier (a
    root-user agent image), "/home/agent/.np" from v7.2.0 onward (PR #554,
    merged 2026-09-03, added a non-root "agent"-user image alongside
    worker-orchestrator support) — confirmed present at v7.3.0, the tip of
    main as of 2026-09-04. Do not copy either value from this file or from
    the module's docs; confirm the actual $HOME of the agent pod/process that
    will run this service (e.g. `kubectl exec <agent-pod> -- env | grep HOME`
    for a Kubernetes agent).

    For a local (host-runtime) agent started via `np-agent -runtime host`,
    use pathexpand("~/.np") instead — see the repo README's "End-to-end
    testing" section.

    Optional ONLY in the packaged deployment model (package_version set):
    with worker_orchestrator = true the module builds no clone path at all —
    it emits a package-exec channel and the agent runs the worker image's
    baked entrypoint. In the git-clone model this is still required, and a
    precondition in main.tf enforces it.

    No default here, as our OWN policy: pin an immutable ref rather than
    track a moving branch. This is not universally enforced by
    tofu-modules — it depends on which ref tofu_modules_ref selects. As of
    v7.3.0 (the tip of main as of 2026-09-04) the service_definition module
    does validate this: non-empty and NOT "main"/"master"/"head"/"latest"

    fetched). That validation was added in v7.2.0 (PR #554, merged
    2026-09-03) — at v7.1.0 and earlier the module had no such validation and
    defaulted repository_branch to "main". Do not rely on the module to catch
    a moving-branch mistake if you pin tofu_modules_ref to an older ref;
    treat the "no default" here as the actual guardrail regardless of which

# Packaged deployment (OCI worker image)
#
# Setting package_version switches this install from the classic git-clone
# model to the packaged one:
#
#   git-clone  the agent clones this repository at repository_branch into
#              base_clone_path and executes entrypoint/entrypoint from the
#              working tree. Runtime tooling (tofu) must exist on the agent
#              or be downloaded at action time.
#
#   packaged   service_definition publishes a package revision whose bill of
#              materials pins the service spec snapshot, every link spec
#              snapshot, every action, and the worker image by digest; the
#              agent association emits a package-exec channel that spawns
#              that image and runs its baked entrypoint. Tofu is baked in.
#
# Both models still register the SPECS over git — service_definition always
# fetches specs/*.json.tpl from repository_branch. The package does not
# replace that; it pins its result.

    This version is the PACKAGE's own and is independent of this
    repository's git tag: bump it on every release that changes either the
    specs or the image. Re-applying the same version with the same
    components is an idempotent no-op.

    Requires tofu_modules_ref >= v7.2.0 — the package, worker_orchestrator,
    package_slug and entrypoint variables do not exist on earlier refs.

    TWO-STEP FIRST APPLY: this service's spec sets use_default_actions, so
    the platform creates its actions server-side. On the very first apply —
    the one that CREATES the specification — those actions have no snapshot
    id yet, so the bill of materials cannot pin them. Apply once to create
    the specs, then apply again to publish a package revision that pins the
    complete set. Subsequent applies are single-step.
